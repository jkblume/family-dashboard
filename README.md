# Family Dashboard

This dashboard should motivate the whole family to be more active/sportly and to live a digital life. But in respect to privacy and data that exist as long as you want!

## Usage

1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all services (except frontend)
1. Start dashboard frontend with `npm run serve`
1. Change directory to imageprocessing. Start the face processing script: `python face_detect_cam.py`.
